# In this and the following exercises, you'll be adding train test splits to the data
# to see how it changes the performance of each classifier
#
# The code provided will load the Titanic dataset like you did in project 0, then train
# a decision tree (the method you used in your project) and a Bayesian classifier (as
# discussed in the introduction videos). You don't need to worry about how these work for
# now. 
#
# What you do need to do is import a train/test split, train the classifiers on the
# training data, and store the resulting accuracy scores in the dictionary provided.

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

#load the dataset
X=pd.read_csv('titanic_data.csv')
#Limit to categorical data
X=X.select_dtypes(include=[object])

from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder

# Create a LabelEncoder object and fit it to each feature in X.
