    "**Answer: ** The dataset contains 395 instances and 48 features. Approximately 67% of student graduated. Since most features are nominal, it's likely overfit using decision tree based classifiers. Also it's not appropriate to use NavieBayesClassifier because it's more likely to underfit without sufficient amount of data. Therefore, I chose K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine. I did not choose Stochastic Gradient Descent (Based on SVM and Logistic Regression) because the dataset is not in large scale.\n",
    "- **K-Nearest Neighbors**\n",
    "** Application:** An example of a typical computer vision computation pipeline for face recogintion using KNN including feature extraction and dimension reduction pre-processing steps(usually implemented with OpenCV). **Strength:** KNN is simple and requires no assumptions as to the form of the model, few assumptions about features. There's only one parameter estimated (k). It performs well where there's a large training dataset, or many combinations of predictor variables. **Weakness**: It provides no information on which predictions are most effective in making a good classification. It requires long computation time. Number of data points required incresases faster than linearity. It's very sensitive to bad features and outliers. **KNN was chosen because we have many features and reasonable size and training dataset. **\n",
    "- **Logistic Regression**\n",
    "**Application:** Logistic Regression has been widely used in economy, marketing and finance. For example, it does a good job in forcasting the direction and strength of stock market movement. **Strength:** Logistic regression is simple, it has low variance and so is less prone to overfitting than decsion tree. **Weakness:** A facility with concept of odds is often necessary. If there's a large number of predictor values, then it's often necessary to reduce them to most important through pre-processing, inferential statistics, bestsubset selection. **Logistic Regression was chosen because we have many features (most categorial) in this binary classification problem. In addtion to KNN, Logistic Regression can provide information on the contribution of individual predictors.**\n",
    "- **Support Vector Machines**\n",
    "**Application and Strengths:** The model is often used in text categorization. SVM performs well for text categorization becuase in text learning, we have to deal with high dimensional features, few irrelevant features, and sparse document vectors. SVM with linear kernel uses overfitting protection and does not depend the number of features. It's effective even if the number of dimensions is greater than number of samples. Also, most text categorization are linear separable. The idea of SVMs is to find such linear (or polynomial, RBF, etc) separators. **Weakness**: If the number of feature is much greater than the number of samples, SVM is likely to give poor performances. SVMs do not directly provide probability estimates, which are calculated using an expensive 5-fold cross-validiation. **SVM was chosen for this problem that we have limited set of points in many dimensions**"
